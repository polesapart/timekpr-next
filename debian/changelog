  * improve username and user shell filter (fixes #2061003)
      usernames which do not conform to standard username patterns are filtered out
      users with no login shell are filtered out

timekpr-next (0.5.6-1ubuntu1~ppa1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * remove UUID upper boundary check (fixes #2046222)
      any user whose ID is greater than UUID_MIN is considered controllable by timekpr
      this helps with systemd-homed, remote LDAP logins etc, where UID is arbitrary high
  * fix a long standding bug when weekly limits are reset together with monthly limits
      this occurs only when new month starts in the middle of the week
  * improve session time accounting for display / reporting purposes
    actually account and display all active and sleep time in case user is logged in for more than 2 days or even more than a week
  * color "apply" buttons and tab pages in red
      to warn users that there are pending changes to apply
  * added keyboard navigation focus order to list type of elements (where there are ediable columns)
      swapped day limit and enabled columns due to weird GTK behaviour when toggle can not be activated using keyboard as first editable item in list
  * disable search boxes on list elements as they pop up using keyboard navigation
      they are not needed and just confuse users
  * fix "verify" button enablement
      it was enabled even when user clicks in and out of "from" field and it contained 0 hour
  * made lists a little wider for adwaita theme not to show horizontal scrollbar
  * fix row positioning "Gtk-CRITICAL" when there is no rows in the list
  * minor dbus performance measurement optimization
  * prevent saving / processing of duplicate timekpr configuration which can happen very rarely
  * when user sets / saves configuration or timekpr loads it from file, log it to the log file
      this way the log file will contain configuration too and that will be enough to ask for debugging if smth goes south
  * added new "realtime" information get method to CLI + translations
  * trying to cover as much DE as we can for idle time accounting (still have to be compatible with freedesktop / gnome standard)
      add more delay to connect to screensaver (hopefully that helps computers with slower DE start)
      rewrote screensaver dbus name detection based on DE name - this should help with some DEs which are
        less known but still have a compatible screensaver interface
      fall back to gnome and then to freedesktop interfaces (gnome is more popular, freedesktop - very few actually implement it)
        if nothing else is detected and works

  * features
    PlayTime left is now shown besides the icon / on label

      fix error handling with empty lists
      properly check allowed day numbers according to allowed values (1-7)
      a small fix for time leak (couple of seconds) on day change
  * technical improvements
      address the situation when session type can change during the session in logind (https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/14925)
      improved session accounting for situations when session type is in tracked list at the same time as in excluded, exclusion takes precedence
      improved session logging to determine why the time for session is or is not accounted
      improved session remaining process killer to include processes that use pseudo-terminals as well as recording a summary of killing results
      prevent an installation error when blindly recreating GTK icon cache even if it is not present, in these cases just create it
      properly check whether an instance of timekpr applications is actually running
      on day change, reset not only this day spent and sleep times, but for next day too
      tiny improvement on sleep time precision
      make admin application to exit gracefully when it was opened from terminal and ctrl+c was pressed (SIGINT)
      less logging in standard debug mode / remove duplicate logging for PT

    admin app will always show actual PlayTime left
    client app will receive actual PlayTime left, but it will show
      minimum of PlayTime or standard time left for that particular day to user (child, subordinate)
  * possibly fix a bug #1917916 when process changed the owner from regular user to system user but was still left in user process list

  * technical improvements
    added ":" as allowed separator for minute intervals (undocumented feature)
    improve a workaround in config loader routines for cases when user makes a mistake while manually editing the config files
    added explanatory comment for values in control files
    print out uname when timekpr starts to better understand the environment the timekpr is running in
    log more information about timekpr performance and computer load average
    log information about day / week / month change
    added elapsed time information output on lowest log level
    rewritten logging routines and implemented buffered log save
    time spent is accounted and saved even when file has been modified externally (this should help with proper time accounting
      (2x+) if user is logged in from multiple machines when commonly shared directory is used)
  * registered bug fixes
    adjust Debian installation suggestions in README (fixes #1910457)
    start using ayatana appindicators because regular ones seem to be deprecated (fixes #1910461)
      adjust for openSUSE too (Fedora does not seem to be using ayatana appindicators yet)
  * unregistered bug fixes
    fixes to client application when <Escape> is pressed instead of close window which leads to empty timekpr windows
    fixes to PlayTime daily limit reset when the day has changed
    fix for PlayTime disabled -> enabled did not work right away when user is already logged in
    fix for user time accounting which added couple of seconds to time spent when using unaccountable intervals
    fix time accounting for PlayTime in override mode and unaccounted time intervals
    fix process handling when process does not have a normal user id that process monitor is interested in and it changed executable
      or process changed user id from one we were interested in to one we are not
    fix timekpr behaviour when user was able to use computer prior the starting minutes of unaccounted hour interval
      now user will be dealt according to defined rules instead of using the computer when he is not allowed to
    lift the terminate / shutdown restriction when termination sequence has been initialized, but admin gives more time prior to
      terminate or shutdown
  * new features
    introduce an option to prevent PlayTime activities to be started during unaccountable ("âˆž") intervals
    introduce an option to monitor PlayTime activities (processes) using first 512 characters of command line
      by default only process name is used for activity detection
    logging level changes are applied immediately
    gray icon for unaccounted hours, which help to distinguish the interval, especially when there is no time left (was: red icon)
    add possibility to edit single daily, daily PlayTime and weekly/monthly limits by editing value directly

  * added option for computer to be woken up automatically if it was put to sleep by timekpr
    additionally it's possible to specify hour interval when it is allowed to be woken up
  * changed termination sequence a little
    if user has no time and locked the screen, user is removed from termination list, which effectively means that
    user sessions won't be terminated unless user unlocks the screen or other user logs in via user switching
    (we should not leave sessions without time left floating around forever)

      if more than 30 minutes are left, notifications are shown every 30 minutes, i.e. one notification
      if more than 5 minutes are left, notifications are shown every 10 minutes as warnings
      if more than a minute is left, notifications are shown every 2 minutes as important warnings

    use non GTK icons that should work in every DE

  * improved allowed days and respective limits processing in case these are not set up properly
    mismatch possible only by manually and incorrectly editing the config file

timekpr-next (0.1.4~ppa1~ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * first alpha version of timekpr (a lot has changed since old timekpr 0.3x version)
  ** new impementation of timekpr-revived (there is almost nothing left of timekpr-revived)
  ** released to very limited testers
  ** python3 and gtk3 are the must
  ** all based on DBUS (server and client)
  ** session management relies on systemd's login1
  ** notifications through DBUS (exclusively)
  ** server is managing everything, except notifications which is the responsibility of client
  ** major features include the following
  *** support DE's which implement appindicaor3 (Unity/Gnome3Â¹/KDE5/...) and legacy statusIcon
  *** support Ubuntu 12.04+ (on launchpad timekpr can support the versions which are on supported distro list)
  *** it's possible to configure which session types are accountable
  *** inactive session time is NOT accounted (if configured so)
  *** time is configurable by days, hours and minutes (yes, limits within hour are possible)
  *** there is no "hard" account lock, user will be logged out in 15 seconds if time is over
  *** synchronous operation between  server and client
  *** improved notifications about system behaviour
  **** notification about actual limit change
  **** notification about general configuration change
  **** notification logic improved
  **** client acts merely as notificator
  **** client can view limits applied by admin

  Â¹ one has to install extension to show timekpr icon, otherwise icon is not shown (gnome architects do not want status icons in their design anymore, timekpr can not do anything about it)
