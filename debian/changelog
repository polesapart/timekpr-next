timekpr-next (0.4.3-5ubuntu1~ppa1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * added lock, suspend and shutdown options as a restriction / lockout types
  * added option for computer to be woken up automatically if it was put to sleep by timekpr
    additionally it's possible to specify hour interval when it is allowed to be woken up
  * changed termination sequence a little
    if user has no time and locked the screen, user is removed from termination list, which effectively means that
    user sessions won't be terminated unless user unlocks the screen or other user logs in via user switching
    (we should not leave sessions without time left floating around forever)
  * proper english label / message corrections from Phil Hudson (thanks!)

timekpr-next (0.4.2-2ubuntu1~ppa1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * fixed #1891921, critical notifications did not show up until final countdown (if show all notifications was checked)
    now critical notification will be shown approx one minute before time will end

  * improved notification frequency and urgency (now only critical notifications are actually critical)
    new frequency values:
      if more than 2 hours are left, notifications are shown every 2 hours
      if more than 1 hour is left, notifications are shown every 1 hour, i.e. one notification
      if more than 30 minutes are left, notifications are shown every 30 minutes, i.e. one notification
      if more than 5 minutes are left, notifications are shown every 10 minutes as warnings
      if more than a minute is left, notifications are shown every 2 minutes as important warnings
      if about a minute is left, notifications are shown every 1 minute (i.e. one notification) as CRITICAL notification

  * improved handling of icons
    use non GTK icons that should work in every DE

  * improved allowed days and respective limits processing in case these are not set up properly
    mismatch possible only by manually and incorrectly editing the config file

  * fix continous time calculation on day change
    this issue did not affect functionality

  * implemented TTY switching functionality for those cases, when login manager sits on different TTY than session itself (this should fix #1823717)
  **  the implementation is as follows: Timekpr-nExT tries to determine on which TTY login manager sits and saves it's TTY number, login managers have their
  **  own users in standard installations, therefore we detect them using specific usernames (maybe not the best solution, but it's a solution)

  ** python3 and gtk3 are the must
  ** all based on DBUS (server and client)
  ** session management relies on systemd's login1
  ** notifications through DBUS (exclusively)
  ** server is managing everything, except notifications which is the responsibility of client
  ** major features include the following
  *** support DE's which implement appindicaor3 (Unity/Gnome3¹/KDE5/...) and legacy statusIcon
  *** support Ubuntu 12.04+ (on launchpad timekpr can support the versions which are on supported distro list)
  *** it's possible to configure which session types are accountable
  *** inactive session time is NOT accounted (if configured so)
  *** time is configurable by days, hours and minutes (yes, limits within hour are possible)
  *** there is no "hard" account lock, user will be logged out in 15 seconds if time is over
  *** synchronous operation between  server and client
  *** improved notifications about system behaviour
  **** notification about actual limit change
  **** notification about general configuration change
  **** notification logic improved
  **** client acts merely as notificator
  **** client can view limits applied by admin

  ¹ one has to install extension to show timekpr icon, otherwise icon is not shown (gnome architects do not want status icons in their design anymore, timekpr can not do anything about it)
